<p align="center">
  A <strong>GraphQL API</strong> wrapping the <strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API</strong>.
</p>

## Usage

Visit https://metmuseum-graphql.now.sh/ and run the following query in the playground:

```graphql
query exploreTheMetCollection {
  allObjects(limit: 10) {
    total
    objects {
      title
      artist {
        displayName
        beginDate
        endDate
      }
      url
    }
  }
}
```

I invite you to explore the schema via the tab on the right side of the UI and build awesome things with this API ðŸ¤©

You can query it like any other GraphQL API, with your favorite GraphQL client or a simple HTTP request: https://metmuseum-graphql.now.sh

The most basic usage would be:

```sh
# ask for the artworks total
curl http://metmuseum-graphql.now.sh -X POST -d "{\"query\": \"{ allObjects { total } }\"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Limitations

You cannot ask more than 20 objects at the same time (= 20 requests in parallel to the REST API), and results are cached one day.

These limitations have been mindfully set to prevent hammering the REST API

## Dev

```sh
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run the Node server
npm run dev
```

## Monitoring

Recommended but optional, you can enable [cache control](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/engine/proxy/guides.html#caching) to avoid hammering the MET API, you'll need an [Apollo Engine API key](https://engine.apollographql.com/).

Once you have one, copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and replace the default value by your API key.

## Aknowledgements

Thanks for the MET team for building an awesome API allowing us to discover more than 470,000 artworks. Find out more at https://metmuseum.github.io.
